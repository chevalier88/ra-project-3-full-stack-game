Thumbing the rusty bullet hole from behind
Ticking anal sex off your bucket list
Tickling the perineum
Tongueing a balloon knot arsehole
Tossing a hairy salad
Touching cloth
Tranny Ally
Treating your Nan to a birthday finger bang
Treating yourself to a sunbed wank
Triple penetration
Trying to convince your partner you got the STI from a toilet seat
Trying to hide being drunk at work after a heavy night
Trying to hide your workplace affair
Trying to lick the tip
Trying to surpress your love of drugs and alcohol
Trying your sister's breast milk
Two in the pink, one in the stink
Uncomfortably confronting your new partner about their body odour
Using an excuse to not have sex

Watching poo porn
Watching your first porn film
Water sports
Wetting the bed next to your partner
Winking arseholes
Wiping away the excess cum you couldn't swallow off your chin
Wishing incest wasn't illegal
Wishing you'd remembered to shower before your gynecology
Wishing your boyfriend's cock was as big as our ex's
Witholding sex to punish your partner
Wondering if you really are the best sex your partner has ever had
Wondering if you've inherited the same genitalia as your parents
Wondering if your Mum has ever had anal
Wondering if your partner has been faking their orgasms

a girl's gotta eat
after 18 holes I can barely walk
aim for the center!
all you can eat for $10!
anything more than 10 inches and we've got a problem
are those rug burns on your knees?
are you allergic to nuts?
are you envious because mine is bigger than yours?
are you going to keep pulling my hair?
are you going to let me finish?
are you going to talk the entire time?
are you open for business?
are you packing heat?
are you ready for a marathon?
at least this one is unique
be sure to wipe that off your chin
bear down and get ready for insertion!
behold! perfection
bend over and grab your ankles!
bottoms up!
can I open up to you?
can I pluck your harp?
can I push your stool in?
can I put this in your trunk?
can I touch it?
can we do this standing up?
can we go somewhere private?
can we just be friends?
can you go any deeper?
can you keep a secret?
can you make a deposit?
can you pump up my dinghy?
careful, this one drools
chocolate rain
cock-a-doodle-dooo!
come out, come out, whereever you are!
deep down I bet you're a real softie
did you bring a friend?
did you know it's Freaky Friday?
did you start without me?
do it for science!
do me next
do you have any ice?
do you have some rope?
do you need help getting off?
do you want a banana smoothie?
do you want the top or the bottom?
do you want to fluff my Garfield?
do you want to know the secret to a good night's sleep?
do you want to share a sausage pizza?
does it always squirt that far?
does the carpet match the drapes?
doesn't that hurt?
don't act like you've never done this before
don't be afraid, get in there!
don't forget the nooks and crannies
don't forget to clean the sheets
don't go anywhere, I'm not done yet
don't go soft on me now!
don't judge me, but I'd do this for free
don't let it get in your eye
don't shoot me in the face!
don't worry, my doctor says it's completely normal
duck, it's about to spray everywhere!
dude looks like a lady
everything tastes better with hot sauce
everything's for sale
excuse me while I whip this out
fake it till you make it
finish yourself off
fire in the hole!
focus on the bits at the top
forgive me Father, for I have sinned
give it a good yank
give it a little nibble
good news, I brought a roll of duct tape
got milk?
have you ever dressed up as a maid?
have you ever had Five Guys?
have you ever tried docking?
have you heard of the Battle of the Bulge?
have you seen the trick where I make a pickle disappear?
here, taste this
here... have a sniff
hit me baby one more time
how are the twins?
how did you get to be so flexible?
how do you like your eggs in the morning?
how long do you think you can last?
how many licks does it take to get to the center?
how much fluid do you have left?
how much longer 'til you find it?
I bet you're pretty good with a harmonica
I bruise like a peach
I can fill that crack!
I can't feel my legs!
I caught you ball watching
I could use a handyman
I dare you to kiss my kitty
I didn't expect it to look like that
I didn't know what a "jiffy lube" was unitl yesterday
I enjoy my meat tender with a warm pink center
I got a coupon for a free footlong!
I got you right where I want you
I hate getting wet when I do this
I hate what I've become
I have a pretty strong gag reflex
I have room for one more
I have this thing with animals
I have to come up for some air
I hear this is good for your skin
I heard you coming
I hope you like fish!
I like a salted rim
I like it rough
I like my buns soft and warm
I like persian rugs
I like the cut of your jib
I like the smell of a fresh mowed lawn
I like the tassels on your curtains
I like them real thick and juicy
I like to dip my berries in chocolate sauce
I like to do this every night before bed
I like to show off my girls
I like to watch
I love a little tease
I love salty nuts
I love to drive stick!
I love trying new things!
I must have blacked out
I need to get my protein in somehow
I need to take a picture of this
I present you the crown jewels
I promise, two seconds and I'm done!
I put my finger over the wrong hole
I see mangos are in season
I see you have all the bells and whistles
I should probably start shaving
I think that's enough for now
I think we're doing this backwards
I want to beat off all my demons
I want to ride the Big Dipper!
I want to taste your signature crust
I wish someone showed me this in high school
I'd like a teabag please
I'd like to propose my stimulus package
I'll be back after I've had a few in me
I'll be shirts and you be skins
I'll give it a good wipe after
I'll have a brownie
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse!
I'll take it black and strong
I'll try your if you try mine
I'm about to give you a tongue lashing
I'm an addict
I'm an organ donor
I'm bleeding... profusely
I'm cramping!
I'm craving sometihing spicy
I'm easy to please
I'm feeling a bit vulnerable
I'm feeling wobbly
I'm getting a burning sensation
I'm going in head first
I'm going to break out my "selfie stick"
I'm going to give you a good spanking!
I'm going to ride this as hard as I can
I'm going to try this with one hand behind my back
I'm having a stroke
I'm hungry like a wolf
I'm just blowin' tonight
I'm looking forward to Bangkok
I'm only going to show you this once
I'm quite the snake charmer
I'm so anal
I'm trying to find the hot spot
I'm waiting for my "Mr. Big"
I've been studying Uranus
I've got a collar and some Beggin' Strips
I've got a pretty good hand
I've got the munchies
I've kept something inside that has to come out
I've never tried doing three in a row
I've never used this entrance before
I've seen things I can't unsee
if it fits, I sits
if there's grass on the field, play ball!
if you don't take a bite, Santa won't come
is it strange if it's shaped like a pop can?
is it supposed to be purple?
is it supposed to itch this bad?
is there a specific position that interests  you?
is this good for chapped lips?
it doesn't look like it did in the photo
it feels good when I stroke it
it flutters when you blow on it
it gets better everytime I look at it
it smells like pennies!
it tastes better when you have two in your mouth
it'll look big in your hands
it's a lot smaller than I expected
it's a weird shape but I like it
It's all in the wrist
it's as dry as sandpaper!
it's deep, it's dark, and scary
it's easier if you use both hands
it's hammer time!
it's hard to work the shaft when the hole is this tight
it's just like riding a bike
it's kind of sensitive back there
it's more beautiful than I ever imagined
it's not too late to change your mind
it's on the tip of my tongue
it's really heavy for something so little
it's showtime!
it's so much bigger up close
it's still wet from this morning
it's time for show and tell
it's time for your performace review
it's time to feed my bunny
it's too slippery, I can't get a good grip
it's warm and ready to go
it's your turn on the slip-and-slide
just beat it
just breathe
just jam it in there
just say the word and I'll give you a hand
keep your balls out of the gutter
last night was a lot of fun
leave the package at the back door
lefty loosey, righty tighty
let me paint your face
let me show you how the pros do it
let me show you the little man behind the curtain
let me strap this on first
let your instincts take over
let's bang this out so I can leave
let's burn some rubber
let's call this a learning experience
let's do it face to face
let's get it on!
let's get naked!
let's get tricky with the ol' reach around
let's get weird
let's go motorboating
let's keep it in the family
let's pin the tail on the donkey
let's play hide-and-seek
let's put a smile on that face
let's put that little budgie in a cage
let's try that with a little less scratch and a little more purr
lick it and let me know how it tastes
liquor in the front, poker in the rear
looks like a full moon
looks like the butterfly is coming out of her cocoon
luckily these pants have an elastic waist
maintain eye contact at all times
mazeltov!
meet me in the bathroom
melon balls and ham, I love the holidays
meow...
my cheeks hurt
my left hand is better than my right
my mouth is watering
my poodle is panting
my precious...
my sister is the best at this
my toes are curling
my turn!
Netflix and chill?
no one can see us together
no pain, no gain
no peeking!
nobody likes a soggy bottom
now that's a mouthful!
oh no... it's getting bigger
once you pay for it, you can play with it
one in the hand is worth two in the bush
ooh that smells
open up! here comes the choo-choo train!
open wide!
pay before you pump
please assume the downward dog
put your lips together and blow
put your pants on
quick and easy, just the ways I like it
release the Kraken!!!
rub it for good luck
satisfaction guaranteed!
say 'hello' to my little friend
shake it a little and squeeze the tip
silent night, holy night
sixty nine?
size doesn't matter
some things are worth waiting for
someone needs a bath
something that big has got to be uncomfortable
sorry, I'm a little rusty
start sucking!
stick your tongue out and say "ahhh"
strap in, it's about to get bumpy!
take it to the rim
thank you for coming
that definitely won't fit
that made my breath stink
that thing is a choking hazard!
that's a cute little beaver
that's a juicy patty
that's a really smooth landing strip
that's a tongue twister
that's a tough one to swallow
that's going to leave a mark
that's quite the turtle-neck
the first hole is a practice hole
the first time is never easy
the force is strong with this one
the hard ones hurt my teeth
the harder, the better
the second coming is imminent
the smell is so strong you can taste it
the wetter, the better
there she blows!
there's a hair on your pie
there's fruit on the bottom
there's not enough sauce on those meatballs
these balls are blue
this furry little bastard smells like s#%t!
this is going to be awkward tomorrow
this is going to go viral
this is how we populate our planet
this is my circus and that's my monkey
this is really making my butt sore!
this is the way my mom likes to do it
this isn't legal in some states
this kitty's got claws
this might leave a stain
this reminds me of great times I had with my father
this seems a little creamy to me
this technique requires you to use two fingers
this will put hair on your chest
those are some big suction cups
those flaps are dangling really low
touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
two heads are better than one
wait till you see my magic wand
wait, I said hand me your clock
want some company?
we can do this the easy way... or the hard way
we got a bleeder!
we're going to need plenty of towels
well it doesn't get much tighter than that
what I put in my mouth is my business!
what is it with you and mayonnaise?
when was the last time you went clamming?
where can I find wood around here?
where is your other hand?
where's the paddle?
why don't you go down, I'll come in a minute
wide load coming through! Everybody move!
would it be wrong to say you smell terrific?
would you do this if you were sober?
would you like a bite of my jelly donut?
would you like a happy meal?
would you like an oral exam?
would you like to lick the spoon?
would you like your muffin buttered?
you are making this harder than it has to be
you be the pitcher, I'll be the catcher
you call yourself a man?
you came just in time!
you can pet her, she's friendly
you can't put a price on a good time
you can't start the day on an empty stomach
you can't tell anyone about this
you clearly play the clarinet and not the saxophone
you completely missed the hole!
you deserve a bigger tip
you just gotta sweat it out
you just made daddy proud
you know I love a good cream pie
you may feel a small prick
you might regret this in the morning
you need to put a leash on that thing
you really gotta whack it
you should be a little sore afterwards
you should eat more pineapple
you should trim your hedge more often
you stained the carpet
you want a sip of my Monster?
you were a disgrace last night
you'd look good in a  pearl necklace
you're beautiful on eht inside
you're dripping all over the place
you're going the wrong way on a one-way street
you're too short for this ride!
you're warm, I like that
you've been a bad boy
you've got good ball control
your brother rubs me the wrong way
your mustache tickles
a good pre-game stretch is a must
blink once for yes, twice for no
can I kiss it and make it better?
can you sign my ball?
can you swallow a sword?
getting rear-ended only hurts at high speed
here comes the climax!
I always drink the pickle juice
I could get behind that
I enjoy watching the train pull into the station
I wish my dad did this with me
I'd love a milk mustache
I'm all fingers and tongues
I'm the fun mom!
I've never gone down under
if you clear out your junk, we can play in the back
it didn't get hard until I went vegan
it's finger lickin' good
it's going to be nut to butt for the rest of the night
it's hump day!
it's not okay to double dip
leave the cash on the night stand
let's double the meat
looks like shag carpet is making a comeback
my honey is the best on the market
once you go black you never go back
push it, push it real good!
ready or not, here I come!
shake those pom poms!
should we invite your sister?
should we put down a tarp first?
spread your legs and put your hands on your head
that tight end is now a wide receiver
the boys are back in town
the cream rises to the top
there's a sucker born every minute
they don't pay me enough for this
this doesn't pass the sniff test
this rooster crows at the crack of dawn
twist it, bop it, pull it
wanna know how I got these scars?
welcome to the Forbidden Forest
you can look but don't touch
you have to try my crab dip
you must be on the naughty list
you put your left foot in, you put your left foot out
you'll never guess what's for dessert
you're not supposed to chew on that
your hose has a kink in it
your mother raised a beautiful succulent
all I need is a good hoe
all pants are half off today
can I have a bite of your taco?
can I slip it in your mailbox?
can you give me a facial?
can you keep it down, I'm working here!
come into my rose garden
did we both finish at the same time?
did you remember to bring the wet wipes?
do you just want to do it yourself?
don't look down, look up
every girl oves a little rabbit
here comes the money shot
I always come the right away
I can feel a rush coming on
I can't seem to put my finger on it
I did all the work, you clean up the mess
I have experience on both ends
I just need a little milk for my Fruit Loops
I like to mix business with pleasure
I'd bend over backwards for you
I'd do almost anything for a hundred bucks
I'm blessed in more ways than one
I'm craving muffin tops
I'm going to go a lot deeper than you think
I'm gonna need the cash up front
I'm headed down south
I'm just yanking your chain
I'm kind of a slow learner
I'm looking for a lot of seamen
I've updated my terms and conditions
if you swallow what's in your mouth, I'll give you more
if you're sitting in the first three rows, prepare to get soaked
in the face!!!
it's a dirty job and I love to do it
it's always good to have a plan B
it's like breaking in a catcher's mitt
it's time to plug it and chug it
keep the back door shut
let me toss your salad
let's go slow, it feels like we're gonna get caught
let's meet at the Bush n' Tush
let's take a look under the hood
look at the size of that crack!
my mama told me not to ride with strangers
my package came today
no more coke
nobody rides for free
not a drop spilled
not everything has to be a competition
please double bag
really? you've never been inside?
rwo in the cake, one in the pudding
sometimes boys just have to be with other boys
the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the goal is to escape
they look like a couple of fried eggs hanging from a nail
they're starting to sag
this one's exit only
wait till you see my new toys
winter is coming
would you like a saddle or do you want to ride bareback?
you can't eat what you can't catch
you can't just wash slime away with a shower
you need a haircut, and I'm not talking about your head
you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
you'll be walking funny tomorrow
you're looking a little stiff
you're my least favorite cousin
you're quite the nutter
