# Technical Review

“Technical” refers to software logic and syntax.

## What went well? Please share a link to the specific code.

Very happy with enabling functional multiplayer and voting via Websockets, and at least having the database able to produce the large dataset of 3500+ cards in card dealing to players.

## What were the biggest challenges you faced?

initially Webpack config, because it never allowed WebSockets to run in the index.js src file.

## What would you do differently next time?

Refactor my code more efficiently, have better routes for the other DB calls i wanted to implement but didn't regarding tracking winners of rounds. Test Webpack with any big libraries like Websockets earlier, and build DB routes earlier.

# Process Review

“Process” refers to app development steps and strategy.

## What went well?

The revised project was more achievable after Robert's feedback. I did not change the project again like I did with Project 2.

## What could have been better?

The design process was straightforward. My problem was time management.

## What would you do differently next time?

Ask for help earlier?
